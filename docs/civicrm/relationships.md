# Relationships

This system allows you to represent connections between contacts by creating relationships.  
For example, if an organization and its representatives are both in your database, it is useful to view either record and see that they are related.

You can also track relationships between organizations or between individuals and organizations. For example, entering an organization in the **Employer** field of an individual's record automatically creates an "Employee of" relationship from the individual to the organization and an "Employer of" relationship from the organization to the individual.

5.  Optionally enter further information:  
    - **Start Date** and **End Date** for time-limited relationships.  
    - **Description** for a short note about the relationship.  
    - **Notes** for additional details about the relationship.  
    - **Permissions** to allow others to view or update the related contact.  
    - **Enabled** to indicate that the relationship is active.  
6.  Click **Save Relationship** when you are done.

### Relationship Permissions

If a relationship is created between two contacts (e.g., Contact A and Contact B), and the **Permissions** box is set to allow Contact A 'View' access to Contact B, then Contact A can view Contact B's details. If the permission is set to 'View and Update,' Contact A can also update details for Contact B.

## Connecting Employees and Employers

A quick way to connect employees (individual contacts) to employers (organization contacts) is to use the **Employer** field in an individual's record. This creates the relationship automatically.

1.  Navigate to the individualâ€™s record.
2.  Click **Edit**.
3.  Begin typing the organization name in the **Employer** field.  
    - If the organization already exists, select it from the dropdown.  
    - If it does not exist, type the name to create a new organization contact.  
4.  Click **Save**.  
    - The system will create an "Employee of" and "Employer of" relationship automatically.

### Other Ways Employees and Employers Can Be Connected

The **Employer** field can also be included on public forms. When processed, the system will attempt to match the employer name to an existing organization to avoid duplicates.
