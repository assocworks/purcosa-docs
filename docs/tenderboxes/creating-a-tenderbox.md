## Setting up Components

1. By default Components are **not** 'required', a Component should only be set as required when it is compulsory for all bidders and not a Component that should be optionally selectable. To require a Component, click the button with the asterisk icon, a red asterisk indicates that it is set as required.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/c788c3a6-4e64-4df3-951e-03bac4c5bcd7/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,101&br_px=1376,870&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=185,277)


2. Enter a name for the Component.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/8b93de6f-c02a-4782-80f1-925baa25a49c/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,98&br_px=1376,867&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=231,277)


3. Optionally add a short description for the Component.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/5d95cb0a-dc9f-43f3-9fb8-a5e92167eb41/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=82,103&br_px=1459,872&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=524,277)


4. By default "Include Price and B-BEE evaluation for this component" is selected. Disable this if Price and B-BEE evaluation is not applicable for this Component.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/821eb1d5-fd6f-451e-8639-274854bae412/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,178&br_px=1376,947&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=166,277)

    When enabled the configuration options discussed below are provided.

### Pricing Formula

By default "Based on lowest price" is selected as the formula to be used. When applicable click the "Based on highest offer (Sale and letting of assets)" option in order to use the formula that favours higher offers rather than lower prices.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/de4132a3-807e-4a5e-a7e4-2951ccfffb76/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,296&br_px=1376,1065&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=166,277)


### Preference Point System

By default the 80:20 system is selected, this means that of a final score out of 100 points, 20 of those points will be determined by the bidder's B-BEE scorecard. Selecting 90:10 will mean that 10 points will be assigned based on the B-BEE scorecard. The last option excludes B-BEE points, leaving 100 points for the "price element" which in all cases can be further customised in a later step.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/a6c09869-841b-4f7f-a08e-54ba6c0ca53a/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,419&br_px=1376,1188&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=166,277)


### Functionality Pass Type

By default "Pass each phase" is selected. This means that when multiple functionality phases are included for this component, the bidder should pass each one in order to qualify for the following one. Alternatively, a pass can be determined based on the bidder's average score (%) across all functionality phases. In this case select "Minimum combines score" and provide the value for the passing percentage.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/4ff13627-3dae-445f-884e-4c15f536c583/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,429&br_px=1376,1198&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=522,277)

### Customised Scoring Elements

By default, 80, 90, or 100 (depending on the selected **Preference Point System**) of the final 100 points will be determined by the bidder's pricing score (the result of applying the selected **Pricing Formula** to that bidder's price / offer). This element can be further customised however.

- Adding a functionality element:
    By setting a number for the value of the functionality element, the specified number of points will be allocated to the bidder's functionality score. (If the value for the functionality element is 10 and the bidder scored 70% for functionality, they would then be awarded 7 of the 10 points.)
        
    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/8835fe89-9999-4c94-8de8-1056bd9e017d/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=745,197&br_px=2122,966&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=895,277)

    You will notice that the points that remain for the price element are automatically updated based on the value provided.

    ![](../img/tenderbox-creating-price-element.png)

- Adding a custom element:
    A custom element can be added by entering a name and assigning a value for it. When assessing submissions for this TenderBox, a field will be provided for the manual capture of the bidder's score for this custom element.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/c5abad20-499e-42f0-8037-54562237a3af/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=745,266&br_px=2122,1035&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=811,277)

    As with the functionality element, you will notice the price element value automatically adjusts:

    ![](../img/tenderbox-creating-price-element-custom.png)

    Click the "Add more" button if you need to add more custom elements.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/f49e2479-d8b2-44de-9d3c-68bcb3c927d2/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=475,330&br_px=1852,1099&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=523,277)


### Additional Points

Additional points can be configured if necessary. These points are **in addition** to the 100 total points. Add an additional points element by entering a name for it and assigning a value.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/eb5753c2-5ee9-470e-886d-fbce0c321feb/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=745,531&br_px=2122,1300&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=813,277)

As usual, click "Add another" to add more additional points elements.

### Price Fields

![](../img/tenderbox-creating-price-fields.png)

By default the total price field is set as 'required' (indicated by the red asterisk), meaning the bidder will not be able to make a final submission without providing a total price. The label and description for the total price field can be adjusted here if necessary.

### Price File Upload Field

The TenderBox can be configured to include file upload fields for more detailed pricing schedules. Enabling this will ensure the inclusion of two upload fields: One accepting a .xlsx (excel spreadsheet) file and the other accepting a PDF document.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/66f4a005-c6c5-40f2-93ff-b2a42ed3d8ae/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,315&br_px=1376,1084&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=172,277)

You are able to set these upload fields as required / optional, as well as specify a label and description to be used.

    ![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-13/2d3b696a-1a56-4c0a-9fde-88f1754b635b/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=93,338&br_px=1470,1107&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=524,277)


### Additional Price Fields

![](../img/tenderbox-creating-price-fields-additional.png)

Here you can provide names and descriptions for additional price fields to be included in the TenderBox, as well as set whether each one is required or optional. Note that values provided by bidders for these fields are not used in any way by the scoring system.

### Allocate Access
