2. **Component name**: This reflects the component name of the current assessment page.
3. **Selection checkboxes  (Assessors Only)**: Used to select one or more bids in order to execute an action (1) on the selected bids.
4. **Status indicators**: A tick or cross indicates that a certain bid is either qualified or disqualified respectively. A trophy symbol indicates that this bid is a winning bid and a contract has been awarded to the supplier.
5. **Supplier name**: The name of the supplier for a particular bid, this is a clickable link which leads to the relevant supplier's contact record in CiviCRM.
6. **Details toggle**: Clicking this will expand / collapse a more detailed summary of an individual bid's scores.
7. **View button**: Click to view the bid submission.
8. **Assess button  (Assessors Only)**: Click to assess the bid submission.
9. **History button**: Click to view the history of the assessment changes made to this bid submission.

### Viewing a Bid's Detailed Scoring Summary

![](../img/bid-assessment-scoring-detail.png)

Clicking the **Details toggle** (point 6 above) will expand a colour-coded table containing rows for each of the following:

1. **Mandatory**: The bid's results for the Mandatory phase.
2. **Functionality**: The bid's results for the Functionality phases, of which there may be one or more depending on the particular tender requirements and TenderBox configuration. One row will be included for each existing Functionality phase, labeled with the name of the phase.
3. **Functionality result**: The overall functionality result for this bid.

Each of these rows provide detail for 3 columns:

1. **Pass**: This reflects the percentage required for a pass. For the **Functionality result** row the "pass type" is shown - usually "pass each" which means each functionality phase needs to be passed in order to qualify for the following one.
2. **Score**: The current score that this bid has achieved based on its assessment.
3. **Assessed**: This reflects the progress of the assessment of this bid for this phase. The colour of this table cell will range from black to bright green according to the level of completion.

For the **Functionality result** row, the last table cell spans across both columns (2 and 3 above), and reflects the overall status - **PASSED** (in a green cell) or **FAILED** (in a red cell).

This format allows the viewer to get key insights into the progress and result of the bid's assessment across all phases with a quick glance.

### Validation Status

The green 'Valid' indicates that the requirement was marked valid during the bid assessment.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-11/51950545-c488-47ef-b85a-257da17cc54c/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=1142,161&br_px=2210,758&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1068&wat_scale=95&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=804,399)

### Comments

Any comments that have been added by assessors are displayed beneath the validation status for each requirement.

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-11/62c8bd41-f00a-445a-b849-4b0df7a7a5cb/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=957,257&br_px=2221,963&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=599,392)

### Scores

Below the comments section the awarded score is displayed (when applicable for the requirement).

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-11/b3ebdb34-61e7-4dc6-859a-f28d9170bc40/ascreenshot.jpeg?tl_px=946,177&br_px=2210,883&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0&wat=1&wat_opacity=1&wat_gravity=northwest&wat_url=https://colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/images/watermarks/ee0000_standard.png&wat_pad=860,420)

In the above example "(0 - 25)" indicates that this is a **range score**, with 25 being the maximum score achievable.

### Pricing

The bidder's price appears last within the pricing section. 

![](https://ajeuwbhvhr.cloudimg.io/colony-recorder.s3.amazonaws.com/files/2024-11-11/79d09917-0010-4959-9293-f525606765d7/screenshot.jpeg?tl_px=0,0&br_px=1197,372&force_format=jpeg&q=100&width=1120.0)

Note: the 'Revised total' field is an internal field used by the bid committee to enter a different price. This is only to be used in the event that the bidder made an error when entering their price (e.g. the bidder entered a VAT exclusive price or made a typing error). The original price cannot be changed, but in the case of a TenderBox configured for price-based scoring, the system will make use of the 'Revised price' (when provided) for scoring calculations.

### Scoring Table

At the bottom of each bid submission is a scoring table. 

The table shows:

- Scores achieved
- Assessment completion percentages
- Pass / fail statuses 

The table is colour-coded, making it possible to see details of assessment progress and the bid's performance at a glance.
