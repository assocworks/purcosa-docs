# Information Sessions

## Info Session Block

We have adjusted the wording and design based on feedback from suppliers registering for Info Sessions. Key changes were made to enhance clarity and prevent misunderstandings.

- **Common Issues Encountered**:

    1. Some suppliers failed to attend physical sessions, mistakenly waiting for online meeting details.
    2. Some suppliers thought that clicking the 'Register to attend' link automatically added them to the Attendance Register.

To address these issues, the following changes were made:

- The registration link wording now clarifies whether the session is online or physical.
- Formatting adjustments to bold 'physical' and 'online' for easy identification.

### Examples of the Updated Information Session Block

The above example also has the address reflected in the info session block. While you may want to consider that this may result in people not registering because they already have the venue, date and times, this example demonstrates that you are able to add any additional information onto the form that is necessary for the event.

## Why Should Suppliers Register?

We encourage suppliers to register for sessions for several reasons:

- **Future Reference**: Adds attendees to the database for future sessions (e.g., Ponder or Conference).
- **Attendance Tracking**: Provides insights into the expected session attendance.
- **Attendance Registers**: Allows pre-printing of Attendance Registers, making on-site management easier.
- **Manual Work Reduction**: Saves time by eliminating manual data entry of attendees.
- **Audit Integrity**: Ensures an accurate record of participation is maintained in alignment with tender requirements.
