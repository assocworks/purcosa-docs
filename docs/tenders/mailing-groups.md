# Creating a tender mailing group

You can create tender invitation mailing groups by searching the "Category import" field with any keyword that was included in the supplier categories from the old site.

**NB** to work effectively add the percentage sign before and after your keyword, e.g. if searching for stationery suppliers use **%stationery%** 

Here is a step by step example:

The old site category was **IT products and services**

1. Open CiviCRM

2. Open the Advanced Search page
