We look at how to find, view, add, edit and delete contacts. We also look at ways to extend and customise contacts, and to change the way that contacts appear in the user interface. Out of the box, CiviCRM comes with three contact types: Individuals - i.e. people Organisations - for example companies or other non-profit organisations Households - typically families that share a physical location Each contact record comes with a set of core fields , including: names (first and last name, etc. for individuals and organisation name, etc. for organisations) greeting and addressee fields for different communication methods contact methods, e.g. email addresses, phone numbers, website addresses, etc. addresses (i.e. physical locations) communication preferences: i.e. the methods that they prefer to be contacted by, and those that they do not want to be contacted by. You can define new contact subtypes based on the out of the box contact types.You can add custom fields that extend all contacts. You can also add custom fields that extend particular contact types or sub types. Think of contacts as the centre of your CiviCRM universe. All of the other building blocks of CiviCRM, like relationships, activities, groups and contributions connect to contacts in some way. A quick look at contacts Contacts are organised into tabs. The first tab that you see when looking at a contact is the summary tab with some basic information about your contact. Following the summary tab are a series of other tabs each showing information about different aspects of the contact. Organising the contact into tabs helps manage the large amount of data it is possible to collect about contacts over time. Tabs get turned on and off depending on what components are enabled and what permissions you have. For example, you will only see the memberships tab if the CiviMember component is turned on and you have permission to see memberships, etc. You can also define extra tabs that display any extra custom data that you want to collect about your contacts. Below we look at the most important parts of the contact screen (including most of the contact with pointers to other parts of the book where appropriate. Contact actions Above the tabs line, you will see a few buttons. The first button is the Actions button which is a handy shortcut to carrying out actions with this contact. For example, you could add a note to this contact, or record a new contribution, meeting or other activity. Summary tab The summary tab shows overview information about your contact. Here you will find names, addresses and contact details as well as details of contact methods. Some fields on this tab are just for individuals, for example, first name, last name, nickname, etc. Other fields are just for organisations, for example organisation name. Individual fields Individuals names are split into the following parts: prefix, first name, middle name, last name, suffix and nickname (you don't have to use all of them). Prefixes and suffixes are selected from a drop down list. If you can't find the value you want, you can add more options to the list from the following screen: Administer CiviCRM > Customize Data and Screens > Dropdown Options > Individual Prefixes (Ms., Mr...) . Addresses You can record one or more addresses for a contact. Each address needs to be at a different location type (e.g. work, home, etc). One of the addresses can be marked as primary and will be used for any postal mailings that you do. You can explicitly choose which location will be primary for a particular person, or let it default to the first one entered. You can share addresses between contacts. For example, you may need to keep information about individual contacts and the organisations where they work. When creating or editing the \"work\" address for an individual, check the \"Share Address With\" box. If their employer already exists in your database, you can select them from the quick search box that appears. Otherwise, you can create the employer's organisation record on the fly by selecting \"New Organisation\" from the \"create new contact\" drop-down. If a person pays you by credit card, the details used for Billing Address in credit card payments will be stored in the Billing location for the contact. If you have a mapping provider enabled you can click on the map icon next to an address to see the location of a contact on a map. Phone numbers You can store multiple phone numbers for each contact. Phone numbers have locations (e.g. work, home, etc.) and types, e.g. landline, fax, mobile. Note that any phone numbers that you add as of type mobile will be available for sending SMS. Email addresses You can store multiple email addresses for each contact. One of these email addresses can be explicitly marked as the address which receives all bulk mailings such as e-newsletters and announcements (e.g. these are emails your organisation would send using the CiviMail component). Any bouncing emails are automatically marked as being on hold when sending emails via CiviMail. See the Email section for more information. Communication preferences and privacy options Communications preferences (i.e. methods of communication that are preferred by contacts) and privacy options (e.g. do not contact me via email) can be defined. Privacy options are respected when carrying out certain functions, e.g. mailing labels are not printed for contacts with the 'do not mail' privacy option, and emails are not sent to contacts with the 'do not email' privacy option. Here is a brief explanation of each of the privacy options in the CiviCRM contact record: Do not phone - The end user has elected to not be contacted via telephone. Do not email - The end user has elected to not be contacted via email. Do not mail - The end user has elected to not be contacted via postal delivery (snail mail) Do not SMS - The end user has elected to not be contacted via text messaging service to their mobile device. Do no trade - The user has elected not to share their info with other organizations. (ie. you may not share or sell user's information to other parties) NO BULK EMAILS (User Opt Out) - This is set when a user selects the Opt Out action in a CiviMail Email. Greetings and addressee fields By default greetings and addressee fields are calculated based on the contacts name fields. For example the postal greeting for an individual called 'Jenny Soper' is 'Dear Jenny'. The default greetings can be configured at a global level here: Administer CiviCRM > Communications > Email Greeting Formats or Postal Greeting Formats or Addressee Formats . Different formats can also be selected for each contact and can also be customised on a contact per contact basis. Relationships tab Relationships are connections between contact records in your database. Each connection can be named to describe the nature of the connection, and a contact may have many relationships to other contacts in the database. In the example below you can see a list of Current Relationships as well as a list of Inactive relationships. You can read more about when it makes sense to use relationships in the relationships chapter of the organising your data section. Activities tab The Activities tab displays a list of all of your interactions with a contact, including all CiviCRM's built-in activities like event attendance, contributions, phone calls etc as well as any custom activities you may have added. It also allows you to record activities with contacts. Clicking on the icons at the top of the screen (Send an Email, Meeting, Phone call) will bring up a screen where you can enter those details. This tab will also show any custom activities that you've defined. To find out more about activities please refer to the Activities section in this chapter. Mailings tab This is only visible if at Administer > CiviMail > CiviMail Component Settings you have unselected Enable CiviMail to create activites on delivery . In that case each bulk email is recorded on the mailings tab instead of the activities tab. This improves the speed at which the activies tab loads if your organisation sends bulk emails to large mailing lists. Contributions tab The Contributions tab shows any financial contributions made by a contact, as well as a summary of the contribution activity of the contact (total amount of contributions over time, total number of contributions, and average amount of contributions). The Contributions tab also allows you to record offline contributions using the Record Contribution button, or record a credit card transaction on behalf of the contact (useful if the contribution has been made by phone) using the Submit Credit Card Contribution button. Both of these buttons lead to forms that allow you to select the Financial Type in addition to the normal contribution information collected from public contribution pages. Read more about Contributions, in the Contributions chapter of this book. Memberships tab This tab displays any memberships a contact has. From this tab you are able to add memberships and submit credit card payments for memberships that require a fee. You can also renew or delete memberships from the \"more\" link on each membership in the contact's existing memberships. Read more about Memberships, in the Membership chapter of this book. Events tab The Events tab displays events related to this contact, for example events the contact has registered for, attended or volunteered at. From this page you can register the contact for an event, and use the Submit Credit Card Event Registration button if the event requires payment. The related payment will then appear on the contact's Contributions tab in the first row. You can also modify the event information as it relates to the contact by clicking the Edit link. For example, you can change the contact's event status from \"registered\" to \"attended.\" Read more about Events, in the Events chapter of this book. Groups tab The Groups tab shows the groups that the contact belongs to. Groups can be used in a variety of ways including mailing lists and permissions ( ACL s). You can add and remove the contact from groups, and see a history of groups the contact has unsubscribed or been removed from. The Status column displays who has added the contact to the group. Whether users can add themselves to a group is one of the settings you can configure when creating a group. When you set a group's visibility to \"Public Listings\" users can join via Profile forms. You may want to familiarise yourself with the discussion on using Profiles for mailing list sign-ups covered in a later section. For more on this topic, please refer to the Groups and Tags section of the book. Notes tab The Notes tab is a place where you can record random bits of information about a contact. Generally you would use custom fields for information you plan to collect about your contacts, but in some cases it may be useful to record additional, ad-hoc notes. Since this information is unstructured, you should be careful about using the Notes tab, unless you know that you or other people using your CiviCRM implementation will remember to look at that tab. When creating a Note, both the subject and the content are free-text fields (i.e. the subject field does not have to be chosen from predefined options). You can specify \"Author Only\" privacy for a note. This means that only the person who wrote the note, or someone with \"view all notes\" permission (via your CMS) can view or edit it. Tags tab Tags are one way of categorising contacts in your database (other methods are Custom Data and Groups). You can configure which tags you wish to use for your organisation. You can search on tags and create Smart Groups based on them. The tags next to Keywords are part of the Keywords Tagset. A Tagset is a specific grouping of tags that you can create. Tagsets are non-hierarchical, and you can create a new tag in a tagset simply by typing a new tag into the field. Existing tags that match what you type will also show up as a list from which you can select. For more on this topic, please refer to the Groups and Tags section of the book. Change Log tab This tab gives limited information about changes made to a contact record. It shows the change date and who made the change, but not what was changed. !!! tip Administrators can use the Contact Logging Report to get detailed information on changes to contact records (who, what and when). Adding contacts The simplest way to add a single contact to CiviCRM is to use the navigation menu at the top of any non-public page. To create a new Individual, go to: Contacts > New Individual: Note that the Contacts menu item allows you to create every kind of contact and contact sub-type. All of the contact creation forms are similarly arranged, with basic information (name, email etc) at the top of the form and more specific fields below grouped by type or subject in accordions (such as address fields, communications preferences and any custom fields that you have added for the contact type). For all contact types you can use the Check for Matching Contacts option to help avoid duplicate entries. After entering all of the information you have in this section, you can click on Check for Matching Contacts. For adding an Individual record to the database, first name and last name OR email address are required. For adding an Organization or Household record to the database, just Organization/Household name is required. You can fill out as many of these fields as you like, and do not forget, you can always go back and make changes as needed by using the edit screen. Useful things to know when adding contacts: Address: You can add multiple addresses to a contact record. This allows you to store someone's home and work addresses, as well as a billing address if that's different. You will see a checkbox here to allow you to share the address of either an existing contact, or create a new contact. If you select new contact, you will need to select which contact type you wish to create, and a pop up box will appear to add the new contact record. When a person uses another contact's address, that address can only be edited from the \"master contact's\" record. The options available in the countries dropdown will depend on which ones you have made available at Administer > Localization > Languages, Currency, Locations under Available Countries. There may be fields here that you do not need. Available address fields can be edited at Administer > Localization > Address settings. The \"Address Name\" field which can be used to label a particular address (for example \"Summer Home\") is hidden by default, but can be enabled from that screen. Tags and Groups: Here you can specify which tags and groups to add your contact to. Please note that you may only add to existing groups and tags with existing tags. You can read more about creating tags and groups in the Groups and Tags chapter of this book. Once you have filled out the form, you have the choice of three buttons to click: Save will save the contact record and take you to the contact screen. Save and New will save the contact and clear the form so that you can add another. Cancel will discard the entered information and return you to your CiviCRM dashboard. Editing contacts Editing information on the summary screen is simple. Hovering in the upper right corner of the block that you wish to edit will bring up the Edit Info link. You can then edit the information directly in the summary screen. If you need to edit a lot information for one particular contact, an alternative is to open the entire contact for editing by clicking on the edit button above the tabs. Note that on the rare occasions that two separate admin users edit a contact at the same time (specifically that they both open the edit screen, then both save the contact), the second admin user will be notified of the first admin user's edit and be given the chance to manually 'merge' the edits. Deleting contacts At the top right there is a button to Delete the contact. When a contact is deleted, it does not disappear completely - instead it moves to the trash, where it can be recovered at a later date (using the search in trash feature of advanced search ). See \"searching\" under the \"working with your data\" chapter for more information). Deleted contacts are moved to the \"trash\" by default (and can be restored later if needed). There are a variety of ways to delete a contact: Single contact : open the contact's record and click the 'delete contact' button at the top of the page. Alternatively, run a search for the contact and, from the results list, look toward the end of the contact's row, click 'More' and select 'Delete Contact'. Multiple contacts : run an advanced search, check the boxes of each record you wish to delete (or select all with the checkbox in the header at the top) and in the 'actions' drop-down menu, choose 'Delete Contacts' to send the contacts to the trash (if enabled) or 'Delete Permanently'. A warning page will be displayed to verify your intention; simply click 'Delete' to continue or 'Cancel' to return to the previous screen. Contact subtypes In addition to the three default contact types (individuals, households and contacts), you can define additional contact types (sometimes referred to as contact subtypes) to suit your needs. Each contact subtype that you define is based on one of the three core contact types. For example, 'Student' would based on the 'Individual' contact type, and 'Farm' could be based on the 'Organization' contact type, or perhaps 'Household' contact type, depending on your use case. Contact types are very useful when you need to collect and display different sets of custom data for different types of contacts (e.g. you may wish to collect information on the subject area and qualifications of all teachers in your database but not be interested in collecting these for other individuals. To do this, you would create a contact type called Teacher, based on Individual and then create a custom data set that only extends Individuals of the type Teacher (see custom data for more information). Note that the core contact types are mutually exclusive, i.e. a contact cannot be an organisation and an individual. However, contacts can be of more than one user-defined contact subtype, i.e. they could be a Teacher and a Parent, for example. To edit existing contact types and and create new contact types go to Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Contact Types . Note that you cannot delete the inbuilt contact types but you can change their names and the images associated with them. To add custom fields to specific contact subtypes, see the chapter on custom fields . Customizing the view of contacts After working with the contact editing and summary screens for a while, you may realise that there are sections and/or fields that aren't useful for your organisation. The good news is that you can easily hide some fields and sections. For example, if your organisation doesn't need to store demographics information, you can remove it by configuring the Site Preferences. Using an account with Administer CiviCRM privileges. Go to: Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Display Preferences . Clear the Demographics box under Editing Contacts. Click Save. You can also use this screen to rearrange the order that the information is displayed in. For further details see Customizing the user interface Similarly, if you want to remove (or add) fields in the postal address section: Go to: Administer > Localization > Address Settings . Check or uncheck fields under Address Editing. Click Save. If you think that some of the tabs are not useful and will not be used in your deployment, you can disable or enable specific tabs from Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Display Preferences . If you don't see some of the tabs described below, you may need to enable them. The visibility of some tabs is dependent on which components are enabled in your installation. For example, the Contributions tab will be hidden if the CiviContribute component is disable.","title":"Contacts"},{"location":"civicrm/contacts/#contacts","text":"This chapter introduces contacts: the basic building block of CiviCRM.

When a contact is deleted, it does not disappear completely - instead it moves to the trash, where it can be recovered at a later date (using the search in trash feature of advanced search ). See \"searching\" under the \"working with your data\" chapter for more information). Deleted contacts are moved to the \"trash\" by default (and can be restored later if needed). There are a variety of ways to delete a contact: Single contact : open the contact's record and click the 'delete contact' button at the top of the page. Alternatively, run a search for the contact and, from the results list, look toward the end of the contact's row, click 'More' and select 'Delete Contact'. Multiple contacts : run an advanced search, check the boxes of each record you wish to delete (or select all with the checkbox in the header at the top) and in the 'actions' drop-down menu, choose 'Delete Contacts' to send the contacts to the trash (if enabled) or 'Delete Permanently'.

Each contact subtype that you define is based on one of the three core contact types. For example, 'Student' would based on the 'Individual' contact type, and 'Farm' could be based on the 'Organization' contact type, or perhaps 'Household' contact type, depending on your use case. Contact types are very useful when you need to collect and display different sets of custom data for different types of contacts (e.g. you may wish to collect information on the subject area and qualifications of all teachers in your database but not be interested in collecting these for other individuals. To do this, you would create a contact type called Teacher, based on Individual and then create a custom data set that only extends Individuals of the type Teacher (see custom data for more information). Note that the core contact types are mutually exclusive, i.e. a contact cannot be an organisation and an individual. However, contacts can be of more than one user-defined contact subtype, i.e. they could be a Teacher and a Parent, for example. To edit existing contact types and and create new contact types go to Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Contact Types . Note that you cannot delete the inbuilt contact types but you can change their names and the images associated with them.

When used properly, both allow for powerful segmentation and searching of your database. Since both groups and tags are methods of categorisation, it can be difficult to determine whether a tag or a group is more appropriate in a given situation. Identifying the differences in their functionality will help you to decide which to use. It can also be good to have a conceptual understanding of the differences between the two. Though there are different takes on how tags and groups should be used, a common philosophy is that tags should be used for descriptive categories of contacts, activities, and cases, while groups should be used for grouping people within an entity that needs to be treated like a cohesive unit (to send mailings to, for example). From this perspective, things like volunteer , ally organisation , vegetarian and musician would be tags with which you could categorise contacts while Volunteer Committee, Allied Organisations Coalition, Vegetarian Newsletter , and This Awesome Band With A Bad Name would be groups to which you could add contacts. Groups Groups are an incredibly important feature within CiviCRM. In addition to their fundamental use as collections of contacts that have something in common, they play a critical role in CiviMail and Profiles, and can be used to set up advanced access rights (on Drupal). Well-defined groups are one of the most important tools available when segmenting your CiviCRM contact database. There are two kinds of Groups \u2014 (Regular) Groups and Smart Groups . Regular groups are just called Groups . You manually place contacts into and remove contacts from a (regular) group. For example, you can manually assign your organisation's board members to a Board of Directors group. You can then easily send board-related emails to each person who is a member of the Board of Directors group without having to search through CiviCRM and select each member individually for the mailing. Smart Groups are automatically populated groups that are configured to include contacts that share a certain set of characteristics or activities. As contacts are added or edited, CiviCRM automatically checks them and adds them to Smart Groups if they meet the characteristics that you have configured. For example, you can create a Smart Group for \"2010 Contributors from California\" that includes contacts who have made a contribution in the year 2010 (an activity) and have an address in California (a characteristic). When new contacts located in California make a contribution in 2010, they are automatically added to this group. Another example is a Smart Group of all donors who have not yet been sent a thank-you letter. As you send your letters, the donors receiving them will automatically leave the smart group, allowing you to always have an accurate list to work from. Group settings and functionality Each group should have a clear, easily understandable group name and a description of its purpose that other database users will be able to understand. Both the name and the description should allow users to quickly figure out what particular groups are for when working in different contexts (e.g. CiviMail). This clarity and specificity is especially important once your organisation has amassed many different groups. If a group is created for a specific person within your organisation, it is a good idea to mention who the group owner is in the description so that in the future someone can check if this group is still used or if it can be deleted. Groups can be assigned the following standard types: Mailing List is used if you plan to use this group as a mailing list in CiviMail. This group type is available for both Regular and Smart Groups. Access Control (Drupal only) is used to assign CiviCRM access permissions to a set of contacts. Only Regular Groups can be assigned the Access Control group type. It is possible to create additional group types to reflect your specific needs. This is particularly useful if your organisation has hundreds of groups as group type can be used as a filter on the Manage Groups screen. To create additional group types go to Administer>System Settings>Option Groups and select Group Type. Visibility Visibility determines permissions for joining and removing contacts from groups. Select \"User and User Admin Only\" if membership in this group is controlled only by authorised CiviCRM users. Select \"Public Pages\" if you want to allow contacts to join and remove themselves from this group via Registration and Account Profile forms. Some organisations find it useful to create a hierarchy of groups. In CiviCRM, this is done by creating one or more parent groups and then assigning other groups to them. When a user sends a mailing to a parent group or searches for contacts in a parent group, all contacts in the associated child groups are automatically included. For example, an organisation that has a national office and 5 regional offices puts constituents in each region into their own group. Then they create a National group which is assigned as the parent group for all regional groups. The national office can now send mailings to the National group, knowing that all contacts in the regional groups that are children of the National group will be included. Group IDs CiviCRM assigns a unique numeric ID to each group. These group IDs can be used for a variety of operations. For example, the group ID can be used to define a URL for group sign-ups. Tags Tags are used to categorise contacts, activities and cases in CiviCRM. You can create as many tags as needed to classify the contacts in your database, though it is advisable to avoid duplicating existing tags or adding too many tags that aren't really necessary. It can be useful to create a standard process for creating and using tags within your organisation to avoid these problems. Groups versus tags {#groups-vs-tags} This is a common question on any project, and the philosophy described in the introduction of this chapter is a guideline, but rules might need to be bent based on how you intend to use your contact segmentation. One interesting benefit of having both groups and tags is that you can perform more refined searches using AND and OR. For instance, if you have journalists, volunteers and members as groups and use tags to identify topics of interests such as development, art and history, you can find all the journalists who are interested in art or development, all the volunteers or members that are interested in history, or any other combination. Beside that, groups have some features that tags don't: - Groups are integrated into several other CiviCRM functions (most notably CiviMail). Contacts can be added to smart groups automatically based on characteristics. Groups can be associated to Drupal Organic Groups. Think of it this way: tags can be applied to contacts, activities, and cases, whereas groups can only consist of contacts. The following outlines the pros and cons of groups vs. tags Benefits of tags Easy to setup and use Easy to search by tags (can use either Basic or Advanced Search) Easy to combine with other properties (like residence state/province) to create Smart Groups Limitations of tags You can not create Tags for use with specific types of contacts (i.e. you can't create tags that are ONLY for use with Individual contacts) When you export Tags, all Tags assigned to a record are exported in a single \"cell\" as a list (e.g. \"Teacher, Volunteer\") Tags allow multiple selections - so they may not be appropriate for mutually exclusive characteristics (e.g. \"Democrat\", \"Republican\", \"Green Party\") You cannot selectively hide or permission Tags on built-in or Profile create and edit forms (you get ALL Tags ALL THE TIME on edit forms) Benefits of Groups Groups are the most flexible way of segmenting your contacts for a wide variety of purposes. Groups facilitate recurring tasks like sending an enewsletter, printing mailing labels, etc. Groups allow you to restrict access to \"special\" sets of contacts Groups support both administrative and end-user \"subscribe\" and \"unsubscribe\" actions - and a history of these actions is kept in the system Visibility settings allow you to decide which Groups are shown to end-users on Profile forms (i.e. some Groups can be \"private\") You can create Smart Groups that combine members of Group A + Group B Limitations of Groups All existing Groups are listed under Manage Groups and in the search forms. This may cause group \"overload\" if your organization winds up with \"too many\" Groups. Groups used for short-term projects should be \"purged\" when they're no longer needed When exporting contact records, all the Groups a contact belongs to are exported as a single comma-separate list (e.g. \"Administrators,Newsletter Subscribers\") You can add contacts to groups in multiple ways: through the Tags and Groups section of the Contact Details edit screen through a contact's Groups tab by using the \"Add Contacts to Group/Tag contacts\" batch action after conducting a search by clicking a group's Contacts link in Navigation Menu > Contacts > Manage Groups . The first two methods also allow you to remove individual contacts from a group. The last two methods allow you to add multiple contacts to groups at once. Individual contacts can be added to a Group either in the contact edit screen or via the Groups tab. Multiple contacts can be added to a group at once by conducting a search, and then selecting Add Contacts to a Group using the More Actions menu. The second way allows you to add multiple contacts to a group by going to Manage Groups, selecting Members for the relevant Group and then using the Add Members to this Group option at the top of the screen. Contacts can also be added to a group as a result of filling out a Profile (see below). Managing Groups To view and manage all groups, go to: Navigation Menu > Contacts > Manage Groups. You can use the Find Groups form at the top of the Manage Groups screen to search for groups by name, type, visibility and whether the group is enabled or disabled. You can also scroll or browse through the list of groups further down the Manage Groups screen. This list includes both regular and smart groups. You can: add contacts to a group by clicking the Contacts link in the group's row edit the group by clicking the Settings link disable or delete a group using the links in the \"more\" pop-up menu. see how many contacts are currently in each group. Finding contacts in a group The Contacts page for each group includes a form for finding contacts within the group. You can search contacts within a group by name, email address, contact type, group status (added, removed, or pending) and tags. Groups and ACL Access Control Lists (ACL) provide finer grained permissioning than what is available through Drupal's Permissions and Roles. Setting up ACLs requires a good understanding of the concept, which is thoroughly explained in the online CiviCRM documentation here: http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Access+Control As with many processes, the key is to make sure you have assembled all the parts before you try to join them together. In this case, you must set up the required Groups, Custom Data Groups, Profiles and Roles before you can use them in ACL. !!! note ACL support for Joomla was introduced in Joomla version 1.6. Removing versus deleting contacts from groups One of the advantages to using groups over tags is that CiviCRM maintains a historical record of group membership. If you Remove a contact from a group, you can see when they were removed and by whom. This can be useful in a number of use cases (e.g. you can track former members of a volunteer group, or if an email subscriber asks why they are no longer receiving your newsletter, you can provide details on when they opted out). If a contact was removed in error, there is an option to Rejoin Group and the contact will be added again. Every group record has a status attached to it: Added , Removed , or Pending . You can search for all of the members of a group by status. Navigate to Contacts > Manage Groups . Identify the group that you want to search within and select Contacts on the right-hand column. From there you can expand the search criteria and you are given an option to search by status. This could be used, for example, if you want to generate a list of all of your former Advisory Board members. You can also Delete a contact from a group. That will eliminate any record of the contact being in the group. Working with tags To view tags, go to: Contacts > Manage Tags (Categories) in the navigation menu. A tag can be edited or deleted using the respective links in its row. New tags can be created by clicking the Add Tag button on the Manage Tags (Categories) screen or by going to Contacts > New Tag in the navigation menu. Each tag should have a clear and unique name and an explanatory description to help users understand the tag's purpose. Tags can be structured hierarchically and designated as subtags of an existing tag by selecting a Parent tag from the dropdown list. Tags can be designated for use for contacts, activities and/or cases. If a tag is designated for use for contacts, it will be available for all contact types and subtypes; tags cannot be specifically designated for use for only one type of contact. Tags are a flexible tool and every user can create more if needed. However, very important tags can be locked to prevent them from being modified or deleted by users who do not have the \"administer reserved tags\" permission (this permission is available in Drupal only). Tags can be assigned to contacts, activities and cases in the following ways: while creating or editing the record from the Contact Summary Tags tab by using the Tag Contacts batch action after conducting a search. You can also use the first two methods to remove tags. Tag sets Tag sets are a free-form way of tagging contacts and are similar to regular tags, but they differ from regular tags in a few key ways: they act as a \"bucket\" to allow you to group tags (i.e. an Issues People Care About tag set might contain the tags \"affordable housing\", \"racial justice\", or \"water quality\") they allow tags to be created on the fly without you having to access the Manage Tags page adding them creates an additional search field in the Basic Criteria section of the Advanced Search Tag sets are created by going to: Contacts > Manage Tags (Categories) in the navigation menu and clicking the Add Tag Set button. Give the tag set a name, a description, and indicate whether the tag set will apply to contacts, activities, or cases. Clicking the Reserved checkbox makes a tag set more permanent - this will prevent a tag set from being deleted by someone without Administrator permission. (Read more about permissions, in the Permissions and Access Control chapter of Initial Set Up section.) Now you can use the tag set to freely tag a contact, activity, or case record. When you create a new tag set, a new field shows up on the edit pages of the entity's activities or cases as well as in the Tags tab for contacts. For example, if you create a tag set called \"Issues Folks Care About\" an associate it with Contacts, you will see the tag set next time you go to the Tags tab of a contact's record. This is an autocomplete field: as you begin to type, CiviCRM looks for matching tags in this tag set and displays any matches below the field. You can select an existing tag or create a new one by typing the entire tag and pressing the Enter key. The tag will then appear within the field in a box. Clicking on the X will untag the record that you are editing (contact, case or activity). Tags created within a tag set will automatically appear in the normal Contacts > Manage Tags (Categories) list and can be viewed and edited from there. However, tags created within a tag set will only be available within that particular tag set. A Note About Searching on Tags and Tag Sets For each tag set you create, a new field will appear in the Basic Criteria section of Advanced Search. You can only search on tags that already exist in this tag set. Searching in the All Tags field will allow you to find records with tags (regular or tagset tag) which contain a complete or partial word or phrase. EXAMPLE: If you have several tags that contain the word 'Donor', you can find contacts tagged with any of them by entering 'Donor' in this field.

You can also use the first two methods to remove tags.","title":"Working with tags"},{"location":"civicrm/groups-and-tags/#tag-sets","text":"Tag sets are a free-form way of tagging contacts and are similar to regular tags, but they differ from regular tags in a few key ways: they act as a \"bucket\" to allow you to group tags (i.e. an Issues People Care About tag set might contain the tags \"affordable housing\", \"racial justice\", or \"water quality\") they allow tags to be created on the fly without you having to access the Manage Tags page adding them creates an additional search field in the Basic Criteria section of the Advanced Search Tag sets are created by going to: Contacts > Manage Tags (Categories) in the navigation menu and clicking the Add Tag Set button. Give the tag set a name, a description, and indicate whether the tag set will apply to contacts, activities, or cases. Clicking the Reserved checkbox makes a tag set more permanent - this will prevent a tag set from being deleted by someone without Administrator permission. (Read more about permissions, in the Permissions and Access Control chapter of Initial Set Up section.) Now you can use the tag set to freely tag a contact, activity, or case record. When you create a new tag set, a new field shows up on the edit pages of the entity's activities or cases as well as in the Tags tab for contacts. For example, if you create a tag set called \"Issues Folks Care About\" an associate it with Contacts, you will see the tag set next time you go to the Tags tab of a contact's record. This is an autocomplete field: as you begin to type, CiviCRM looks for matching tags in this tag set and displays any matches below the field. You can select an existing tag or create a new one by typing the entire tag and pressing the Enter key. The tag will then appear within the field in a box. Clicking on the X will untag the record that you are editing (contact, case or activity). Tags created within a tag set will automatically appear in the normal Contacts > Manage Tags (Categories) list and can be viewed and edited from there. However, tags created within a tag set will only be available within that particular tag set.","title":"Tag sets"},{"location":"civicrm/groups-and-tags/#a-note-about-searching-on-tags-and-tag-sets","text":"For each tag set you create, a new field will appear in the Basic Criteria section of Advanced Search. You can only search on tags that already exist in this tag set. Searching in the All Tags field will allow you to find records with tags (regular or tagset tag) which contain a complete or partial word or phrase. EXAMPLE: If you have several tags that contain the word 'Donor', you can find contacts tagged with any of them by entering 'Donor' in this field. Read extensively on using Advanced Search in the Searching section.","title":"A Note About Searching on Tags and Tag Sets"},{"location":"civicrm/relationships/","text":"Relationships CiviCRM allows you to represent connections between contacts by creating relationships. For example, if a mother and son are both in your database, it is useful to be able to look at either record and see that they are related to each other. You can also track relationships between organisations, or between individuals and organisations. For example, entering an organisation in the Current Employer field of an individual contact's record automatically creates an \"Employee of\" relationship from the individual to the organisation, and an \"Employer of\" relationship from the organisation to the individual. Creating relationships between contacts Navigate to one of the records that you want to relate. Click on Add Relationship from the Actions button on the contact summary, or from the Relationships tab Select the Relationship Type. In this case it would be \"Sibling of\". Begin to type the last name of the related person(s). If you discover that a contact you want to connect is not yet in the database, you can create a new contact from this screen. Optionally enter further information: Start Date and End Date if the relationship is time limited. Description - short text that shows on the relationship summary screen. Notes - longer text shown when viewing the relationship. Permissions - allows other users of the database to view or update the related contact. Enabled - shows the relationship is active. When you have made the changes you want, click Save Relationship . Relationship permissions If a relationship is created between two contacts User 1 and User 2 and the Permissions box is set to allow User 1 'View' access to User 2, then when User 1 is logged in they can view details about User 2 using a Profile in View mode. If the permission is set to 'View and Update' then User 1 can also update details about User 2 with a profile in Edit mode. This functionality can be extended using the Related Permissions extension. Connecting employees and employers A quick way to connect employees (which are stored in CiviCRM as individuals) to employers (stored as organisations) is to use the Current Employer field within an individual's record. This will set the current employer field in the contact record and create a relationship between the contacts. Navigate to the record of the individual who you want to connect to an organisation. Click the Edit button Begin typing the organisation name into the Current Employer field. As you type, matching names of organisations that already exist as contacts in CiviCRM will appear in a dropdown autocomplete list below the Current Employer field. If the organisation is already a contact in CiviCRM you can select it from the dropdown list by pressing the down arrow key or by clicking on it. If the organisation does not already exist as a CiviCRM contact, simply enter the full organisation name. After the organisation's full name is entered in the Current Employer field either press the Enter key or click the Save button. If the organisation is a pre-existing contact, an Employee/Employer relationship will be created between the individual and the organisation. If the organisation does not already exist, a new organisation contact will be created and the relationship will be created between the individual and the organisation. You can click on the Relationships tab to view your newly created relationship Employee of and see any existing relationships. Other ways employees and employers can be connected Employees and employers can be connected using the Current Employer field on CiviCRM Profiles and CiviCRM Contribution Pages. When the Current Employer field is shown, the user can enter the name of their Employer, it is not presented as a select list to preserve privacy. When the form is processed, CiviCRM will check the Current Employer field and attempt to match an existing Organisation contact before creating a new one, thus reducing potential duplicates . The first check is performed using the Deduplication Rule, Organisation Unsupervised . If a matching Organisation contact is found, this contact is used and no new contact is created. The second check is to compare if the Individual contact has an existing Current Employer with the same name as provided on the form. If matching, this contact is used and no new contact is created. And lastly, if no match is found then a new Organisation contact is created and the Employee Of Relationship created to link the Individual and the new Organisation contact. Adding contacts to organisations Select the desired contacts from your search results as described above. Select Add relationship - to organization from the dropdown from the Actions menu. On the Add Contacts to Organization screen, select the Relationship Type from the dropdown menu. Enter part of the desired organisation name in the Find Target Organization field , then click Search . Organisations that match your search will appear in the Mark Target Contact(s) for this Relationship section below the Search and Cancel buttons. If the organisation you're looking for appears in this list, click the radio button next to that organisation and then click the Add to Organization button below. If the organisation you're looking for does not appear in this list, try entering something different into the Find Target Organization field and clicking Search again. If you are still unable to find your desired organisation it may not exist; click Cancel , add a new organisation, and try again. After you've successfully chosen an organisation and clicked the Add to Organization button, you should see a message stating that the number of participants that you selected have been added to the organisation. Click Done to return to your search results. Adding contacts to households Select the desired contacts from your search results as described above. Select Add relationship - to household from the dropdown Actions menu. Select the Relationship Type from the dropdown menu. Note that while CiviCRM will not stop you from adding multiple contacts as Head of Household for a single household, this may cause problems later on in any situation where you are expecting Head of Household to refer to only one individual per household. Therefore, the Household Member of option may be the better choice in most situations. Enter part of the name of the household to which you are adding contacts (such as a last name shared by household members) in the Find Target Household field, then click Search . Households that match your search will appear in the Mark Target Contact(s) for this Relationship section below the Search and Cancel buttons. If the household you're looking for appears in this list, click the radio button next to that household and then click the Add to Household button below. If the household you're looking for does not appear in this list, try entering something different into the Find Target Household field and clicking Search again. If you are still unable to find your desired household it may not exist; click the Cancel button, add a new household, and try again. After you've successfully chosen a household and clicked the Add to Household button, you should see a message stating that the number of participants that you selected have been added to the household. Click Done to return to your search results. Creating new relationship types CiviCRM comes with a set of common relationship types that can be used to indicate relationships between contacts. If you need to track different types of relationships between your contacts, you can create your own custom relationship types. In the navigation menu, go to: Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Relationship Types . Review the list of existing relationship types to ensure that you are not creating a duplicate. If the relationship type you need does not already exist, click the New Relationship Type button. Enter descriptive labels for the relationship type you are creating in the Relationship Label-A to B and Relationship Label-B to A fields. The Relationship Label-A to B field describes the relationship between Contact A and Contact B; the Relationship Label-B to A field describes the relationship between Contact B and Contact A. Some relationships can be described by the same label in both directions; in these cases you can enter the Relationship Label once in the Relationship Label-A to B field. For example, when describing the relationship between two domestic partners named Sylvia and Audre, you can say that Sylvia is the \"Partner of\" Audre and Audre is the \"Partner of\" Sylvia. Therefore you would enter the \"Partner of\" label only in Relationship Label-A to B field, leaving the Relationship Label-B to A field blank. In other situations one Relationship Label cannot be applied in both directions; in these cases you need to enter different Relationship Labels in each of the Relationship Label fields. For example, you can say that Kiyoshi is the \"Grandparent of\" Yuki but you cannot say that Yuki is the \"Grandparent of\" Kiyoshi. Therefore you would enter the \"Grandparent of\" label in the Relationship Label-A to B field and either \"Grandchild of\" or \"Grandparent is\" in the Relationship Label-B to A field. Use the Contact Type A and Contact Type B fields to designate which contact types are being linked by your relationship. Remember to check that the contact types you select for Contact A and Contact B make sense when corresponded to your Relationship Labels. Optionally enter Description for this relationship type. This is especially useful if the intended purpose of this relationship type may not be obvious to other users. Leave the Enabled box checked unless you intend to create this relationship type but not allow users to utilise it until a future date. Click Save . You will see a message telling you that the relationship type has been saved and you will see your new Relationship Type in the list below. Creating custom fields on relationships CiviCRM provides a number of standard relationship fields, described above. You may decide there is other information you want to store, either on all relationships, or just on given relationship types. Additionally, custom fields can be used as a tool to further distinguish relationships without creating inordinate numbers of types (e.g. you could track which department an employee works in using a custom field, rather than creating a new relationship type for each). You can add custom fields that display on the relationship types of your choosing. See creating custom fields for detailed instructions. Disabling or deleting unneeded relationship types If an existing relationship type is no longer useful or relevant for your organisation you can either disable or delete it so it is no longer presented as an option for new relationships. Disabling rather than deleting the relationship type has two significant advantages: you will still be able to see existing data on relationships of this type, and you can easily enable the relationship type again should you find you need it later. In the navigation menu, go to: Administer > Option Lists > Relationship Types . Click the More link in the row of the relationship type that you'd like to disable or delete. Select either Disable or Delete from the pop-up menu. If you select Disable, a pop-up confirmation bubble will appear. If you select Delete, you will be directed to an additional screen that provides a more serious warning and requests confirmation. Review the information provided in either confirmation message and if you are sure you'd like to complete this action, click the Delete button otherwise Cancel . If you have chosen to disable the relationship type it will appear in red in the Relationship Types list and relationships of this type will still be visible when viewing contacts. If you have chosen to delete the relationship type it will no longer appear in the Relationship Types list or in contact relationships data. In either case users will no longer be able to create new relationships of this type. To enable a previously disabled relationship type, follow steps 1 and 2 above and select Enable from the more pop-up menu.","title":"Relationships"},{"location":"civicrm/relationships/#relationships","text":"CiviCRM allows you to represent connections between contacts by creating relationships.

We will start off with some simple searches and then move on to more advanced techniques. CiviCRM beginners should be familiar with Quick search, Advanced Search and the component searches. More advanced users should also look at Search Kit reports, custom searches and Search Builder. Overview In this introduction we will discuss at various level of detail: Quick search - how to quickly search for contacts. Advanced search - how to really dig deep for contacts with lots of search possibilities. Search Builder - how to build your own searches (though if you are using CiviCRM version 5.20 or later you should really look into Search Kit too). Full-text search - how to search for something in all the available text fields in the database. Component search - on searching within specific component entities like events, memberships, cases, contributions etc. Custom searches - using the available custom made searches that can be from CiviCRM core or from one or more of your specific extensions. Search actions - what you can do with the results of your search (or sometimes report). The contact summary pop - what you can see and change in the popup when hovering over a contact icon in your search results. The wildcard - using \"%\" or \"%_%\" in your searches as a wildcard. Case sensitivity - what you can do with upper or lower case in your search. Default number of rows - how many results are returned in your searches and how you can change that number. Search Kit - a brief link to the Search Kit functionality. Searching and reporting There are three main reasons to search: To find a specific contact: the Quick search box can find contacts by name, email address or a variety of other characteristics To perform an action on a contact or contacts that meet certain criteria. For example, you might want to find all contacts in the advisory group in order to invite them to a meeting, find all those whose memberships have recently expired to send a renewal reminder, or find all contacts aged under 25 in a specific location to send them an email about an upcoming event nearby For ad-hoc reporting As a form of ad-hoc reporting, searching is often useful but does have limitations. For example, you can't group results by particular criteria, summarize, or easily produce graphs of the results. For more advanced reporting, see the CiviReport section. Quick search The easiest way to find a specific contact is to use the Quick search box that appears in the navigation menu at the top left of the screen. You may choose to search by one of several criteria. The criteria can be modified by going to Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Search Preferences . On the Search Preferences page, options are available to customize CiviCRM's Quick search to hide contacts' basic fields that are not normally used in a Quick search and to add custom field options. Once you click in the Quick search box, you can start typing immediately to use the default Name/Email search or you can click again to expose several other criteria in a dropdown selection list. Contacts that match the phrase you enter will appear in a dropdown list below the box. For example, if you are searching with Name/Email and you have left automatic wildcard enabled via Search Preferences , entering \"peter\" will find: people who's first or last name is Peter people who have Peter appearing as part of their name, e.g. Mary Peter son people who have Peter as part of their email address, e.g. blue peter @gmail.com organisations with Peter in their name, e.g. Al peter Community Centre. You often don't need to type the full name of the person - just the first few letters. However, if you don't see the contact you are looking for, either refine the search by typing more characters, or hit the Return key to convert your search into an Advanced Search. Quick search displays up to 10 results (by default). You can change the number of results returned from the Search Preferences screen described above by changing the Autocomplete Results setting. CiviCRM also allows for the collection of a nickname when entering new contacts. For example, \"Joe\" can be a nickname for \"Joseph\" and \"IBM\" can be a nickname for \"International Business Machines\". When you first install CiviCRM you will find \"Joseph\" when searching for \"Joe\" and you'll find \"International Business Machines\" when searching for \"IBM\". You can change this behavior from the Search Preferences screen described above by changing the Include Nickname setting to yes . !!! note If you search by phone then you will need to enter the digits of the phone number without any formatting. The phone search is done against a field that consists only of digits with all non-numeric characters stripped out. !!! tip If you want to search by first and last name, use the format \"Lastname, Firstname\", not \"Firstname Lastname\". For example, \"Peterson, Mary\" not \"Mary Peterson\". Advanced search Advanced search allows you to search across all the information you have about your contacts. For example, you could find \"all contacts in Venezuela\" or \"all advisory group members\". If you specify two or more categories of information, the search displays every contact that matches all the categories. For instance, you can combine the two criteria just mentioned to find \"all advisory group members in Venezuela\". The Advanced search screen is accessible from the navigation menu Search > Advanced Search . On this screen, search criteria are grouped into sections which refer to different types of data that you can search on, such as address data, notes and information from components such as Contributions or Events. Each group of criteria is shown as a blue bar (known as an \"accordion\" because it expands when you click on it). For example, if you want to search for all people in your database from 16 to 18 years old, click on the Demographics accordion. When it opens, you can specify the birth date range you are interested in. Display Settings For Results Advanced Search returns your results as Contact records by default. However, you may want to get another record type instead. For example, you may want to search on the Membership renewal activity to find everyone who renewed their membership last week then display the results as Memberships so that you can export name, address and Membership expiration date to create and then post out membership cards to those contacts. Simply select the record type you want from the Display Results As dropdown. Views for Display Contacts Advanced search allows you to change the columns displayed in your search results. The default columns are Name, Street Address, City, State, Postal Code, Country, Email and Phone. If you want to display a different set of columns (perhaps to include a custom field or remove a column you don't need), create a Profile with the Search Views option selected. Make sure that the fields in this Profile are set to \"Expose Publicly and for Listings\" visibility, and are marked as Results Columns. (For more information about creating Profiles, which are described in detail in the Profiles chapter in the Configuration section.) For example you may want to include columns for Gender and Date of Birth, while eliminating Country. Create a profile that includes birth date, gender and address fields. Read more about creating profiles in the Profiles section of the chapter on Organising Your Data . Combining this feature with the \"Batch Update via Profile\" action provides a powerful method of viewing and updating a specific set of fields across a batch of contact records. Search settings The Search Operator determines whether your criteria are combined with AND statements, or combined with OR statements. For example, you may want to find all individuals who are in the Volunteers group AND who have a Volunteer Training activity recorded for them. In this case use the AND operator. If you need to find everyone who is in the Volunteers group OR has a Volunteer Training activity recorded, use the OR operator. The Search in Trash allows you to search contacts that have been deleted but not deleted permanently. When a contact is deleted, the contact and all related data are moved to trash. Only users with the relevant permission will be able to search in trash and will be able to restore the contact from trash. The Date Range Filter Most component searches include a date range filter. The images below show examples of both: by using an absolute date range, e.g. \"1st Jan 2010\" to \"31 July 2010\" by using a relative date range, e.g. \"Previous week\" Relative date ranges are especially useful for searches that you would like to then save as Smart Groups (automatically populated groups that are configured to include contacts that share a certain set of characteristics or activities). For more information see the Groups and tags section in the Organising your data chapter. For example you may want to use a relative date range search to find: Contacts who have contributed in the last 7 days (Relative date range - \"From 1 Week ago\") This (financial) year's registered Event Participants (Relative date range - \"This Year\") Contacts who are a certain age Relative dates filters based on the time interval \"week\" assume that Sunday is the first day of the week. This is not true in all countries, for example Europe and many countries in Asia/Pacific region consider Monday to be the first day of the week. To set which day is the first day of the week, you need to go to Administer > Localization > Date Format . Combining search criteria Different criteria are combined by \"ANDing\" them. For example, if you select the tag \"major donor\" and the country \"Mexico\", the search will return major donors from Mexico. The search will not return major donors who are not from Mexico, nor those from Mexico who are not major donors. You can change the default search operator from AND to OR in the Search Settings. Within criteria groups that allow you to check boxes for more than one value, these options are also combined by \"ANDing\". For example, you can search for contacts whose Preferred Communication Method is both Email AND SMS. With fields that allow you to select more than one value from a dropdown list, the values are always combined with OR. For example, you could find contacts that live in Alaska or in Arizona. If you expand one of the dropdown sections, and make selections, as shown above, a cross appears at the right end of the header, indicating that this panel is being used in the search. If you no longer wish to use Address Fields as a part of the search, it is not enough just to close the panel. You must click the cross on the header. Limitations of Advanced Search The Advanced Search is an effective way to search for many things in CiviCRM. However, there is an issue with searches where Contacts are the client in more than one Case, and they are engaged in the same Activity Type in each of these Cases. The Advanced Search is currently not able to filter these Activities correctly by Case Type. This issue is expected to be resolved in the near future. Search Builder Advanced search lets you choose from a wide range of criteria in a user-friendly panel, but this has limitations. Search builder allows you to define your own search and arrange the criteria according to your specific needs. Search Builder allows you to choose from a range of operators: Operator Purpose Example = Equals. Matches on the exact value you specify \"First Name\" = \"Bob\" will find contacts who's first name is exactly \"Bob\" \u2260 Not equals. Matches on everything that is not the specified value. \"Gender\" \u2260 \"Female\" will find contacts who are not female > , \u2265 Greater-than, greater-than-or-equal-to \"Birth Date\" \u2265 \"Jan 1 2000\" will find contacts born on or after Jan 1 2000 < , \u2264 Less-than, less-than-or-equal-to \"Last Name\" < \"J\" will find contacts whose name starts with a letter that comes before J in the alphabet In Value is one of those you specify \"Group\" In \"Board Members, Staff\" will find contacts who are in either of the specified groups Like Same as the = operator, but supports the % wildcard character \"Last Name\" Like \"Gree%\" will find contacts whose last name begins with \"Gree\" (Green, Greenberg, etc) Regex Same as the = operator, but supports all regular expression operators. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expressions \"Middle Name\" Regex \"[a-c]\" will find contacts whose middle initial is A, B or C Is Empty, Not Empty Empty means the field exists and is equal to the number zero or contains nothing. \"City\" Is Empty will find all contacts who do have an address but the city was left blank Is Null, Not Null Null means the field does not exist or contains nothing. \"City\" Is Null will find all contacts who do not have an address at all Search Builder also allows you to combine criteria with multiple AND and OR groups. To AND criteria (which means to find results matching all criteria specified), click Another search field and enter criteria under Include contacts where . To OR criteria (which means to find results matching either one OR the other criterion), enter one criterion in Include contacts where and the other under Also include contacts where. The following example will search for females born after Jan 1 2000 OR members of the Administrators or Advisory Board groups: Your search results will contain each contact's name, plus a column for each search criterion you've defined. If you export search results, the export file will contain those same columns. Just like other searches, you can choose from a list of actions to apply to the results of your search. If you export results, you can select fields for export. Note that the fields you searched on will get exported by default in addition to those you select. You can also save your Search Builder search as a Smart Group. For more information on Smart Groups, see the Groups and Tags section. Full-text Search You can use this to search for text values all fields of the database. This is particularly useful, for example, if you can remember specific words that you have used but can't remember where you have put them. For example, lets say that you recorded an activity with a contact and added specific words to the description but have now forgot the contact's name. You can use Full text search to find the contact and activity by words that you remember from the description. Component searches Most CiviCRM components offer a search on the data they maintain, such as Find contributions , Find members , etc. These forms work in a similar way to Advanced Search but return rows of the main objects associated with the components, instead of contacts. Find Members returns memberships, Find Participants shows event registrations, Find Contributions returns contributions and so on. Each component search has its own Action list. See the Component chapters for more details. Note that you can also use the Advanced Search in conjunction with Display Results As to search for component objects based on criteria available in Advanced earch. For example, you could find all event attendances from contacts that are also members. Custom searches Custom searches are designed to answer specific questions that can't be easily answered using Advanced Search or Search Builder. Go to Search > Custom Search in the navigation menu and look at the list of available custom searches.These customized searches have been written by members of the CiviCRM community to meet their own needs, and then contributed back to the community to share with others who need the same or similar custom searches. It's worth spending some time exploring these searches as some may be useful to you, and they will give you an idea of the sorts of things that are possible. Though some of these searches can be done in the Advanced Search (especially in later versions), custom searches are also set up to display results according to your search and may provide more useful columns in the results for your needs. Here's a short description of the custom searches available. Finding contacts in one group but not in another This is probably the most popular custom search. When using Advanced Search, if you select several groups in the Group list near the top, it will treat the search as an OR search, and return results for contacts who are in any of the groups you select. If you want to find contacts who belong to all of the selected groups, you will need to use Search Builder. There is also a very useful built-in custom search, \"Include/Exclude Contacts in a Group/Tag\", that enables you to find contacts who are in one group but not in another, which you can find by going to Search > Custom Searches in the navigation menu. By combining Include and Exclude options, you can find contacts who are in one group but remove just the group members who fit another criterion. For example, you may want to find all the contacts who are Newsletter Subscribers or volunteers, but exclude members of Advisory Board, perhaps to create a new mailing list to receive a message targeted at the most external circles of your constituents. Household Name and State Search households in a state or province. !!! note Which states or provinces are available in the search depends on your localization settings. Add additional countries by going to Administer > Configure > Global Settings > Localization . Add to the column of \"Available States and Provinces\", but note this change will also affect profile forms which include country or state/province fields. Contribution Aggregate Find aggregate totals of contributions from contacts within a range of dates. Postal Mailing Search for contacts in a given group and display results with mailing information. Use this search to batch update contact information, send an email, export contacts, or other actions. Proximity Search Search for contacts located within x miles/kilometres of a specific geographical area. Go to Search > Custom Searches > Proximity Search Enter the distance in miles or kilometres. Enter the country within which you want to search. Enter any other parameters you wish to give your search. Click Search . !!! tip You can also incorporate Proximity Searching in a profile which you've configured for use as a search form. Event Aggregate Search on event-related payments for a given event or event type in a given date range. You may also limit results to show credit card payments only or payees only. See also event reports for more useful event search options. Price Set Details for Event Participants Get detailed information about which participants opted for which different paid options related to an event. For example, see who paid just the event fee, who paid for the additional workshop and who paid for dinner. Find Contribution Amounts by Tag Search on any tag for contributions within a range of dates. Zip Code Range Find contacts in a specified zip code or postal code range. This is useful for targeted mailings or conducting surveys in a particular geographical area. Go to Search > Custom Searches > Zip Code Range . Enter the start and end range of the zip or postal codes. Click Search . Date Added to CiviCRM Search for contacts that have been added within a particular time period. Including a group displays just those added within the specified time frame who are also in that group. Excluding a group removes those group members from the results. Custom Group Multiple Values Listing A search for multi-value custom data. Contributions made in Year X and not Year Y Search for contributions that have been made in one year but not another. This is useful for following up semi-regular donors and encouraging them to donate more regularly. See also the LYBUNT and SYBUNT reports. None of the fields are required; you can choose whether to search a specified amount range as well as a time period, and whether you want to exclude minimum or maximum amounts. It is possible to write your own custom searches, but you'll need to be comfortable with MySQL and PHP. See the Developer wiki at http://wiki.civicrm.org/confluence/display/CRMDOC/Develop for more information about how to do this. If you create a custom search that you think could be useful for others, consider contributing it back to the community. The 'search-action' workflow After you retrieve your search results, you can perform a number of actions. An Actions box appears above the results. You can select either all records or specific records, then carry out an action with the selected records. Different actions are covered in more detail in the chapter on Everyday Tasks. Some of the most commonly used actions are Add Contacts to Group, Export Contacts, Map Contacts, and creating and printing Mailing Labels. (To use Map Contacts, you will need to configure Mapping and Geocoding. You can read more about this in the Installation chapter of the Configuration section of this manual). For example, to send email to a selected number of contacts, mark the contacts you are interested in and then select Send Email to Contacts in the dropdown list of actions. The contact summary pop-up You can see a pop-up box with detailed information for any contact listed in your search results by hovering over the contact icon in the left column, as shown below. You can adjust the fields shown in this \"pop-up view\" by modifying the fields included in the \"Summary Overlay\" profile ( Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Profiles ). The wildcard (%) Understanding wildcards greatly expands your search options. A wildcard represents any character (letter, numeral or punctuation mark). In CiviCRM, the wildcard is represented by the % symbol (you may be familiar with other symbols such as * from other applications). It is most easily understood through examples. Suppose that somebody asked you to find a contact with a first name similar to \"Michael\", but possible something different such as \"Michelle\" or \"Micha\u0142\". If you search for \"Mich%\" you will find all these variations, including a contact who is supposed to be named \"Michael\" but whose name was misspelled as \"Micheal\". Wildcards can be used before, after, or even within words. For example, searching on 'Mich%el' will exclude \"Micha\u0142\" and \"Micheal\" but still find \"Michelle\" and \"Michael\". However, using % by itself can produce unexpected results for data where the value in the database is 'empty' (as opposed to NULL. Using a single % will return results for empty values. To avoid these results, eg if you are searching \"any record which has any data in this field\" using %_%. This will return results only where there is at least a single character, and will ignore all empty (as well as NULL) results. Case sensitivity Note that when you search for character strings, the search is not case-sensitive. For example, if you search for 'brooklyn', the search will return strings with capitalised letters if the string exists, e.g. 'Brooklyn' or 'BROOKLYN'. Entering \"mi%el\" in lowercase will also find contacts with an upper case 'M' in their name. Default number of rows to be returned. In CiviCRM Advanced Searches and in CiviCRM reports the number of rows displayed on the screen has by default been 50 previously. As of CiviCRM version 5.39 System Administrators can under Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Search Preferences change the number of rows to be outputted on the screen. You should not set too high a number as the higher the number, the slower the screen will be to load. Search Kit As of CiviCRM version 5.29 Search Kit is new functionality with lots of exciting possibilities for searching, reporting and potentially much more. The development continues, the functionality will evolve over time and so will the documentation. The section Search Kit covers that current state.","title":"Searching and reporting"},{"location":"civicrm/searching/#introduction","text":"This chapter covers different ways to find information you've stored in CiviCRM.

For example, you might want to find all contacts in the advisory group in order to invite them to a meeting, find all those whose memberships have recently expired to send a renewal reminder, or find all contacts aged under 25 in a specific location to send them an email about an upcoming event nearby For ad-hoc reporting As a form of ad-hoc reporting, searching is often useful but does have limitations. For example, you can't group results by particular criteria, summarize, or easily produce graphs of the results. For more advanced reporting, see the CiviReport section.","title":"Searching and reporting"},{"location":"civicrm/searching/#quick-search","text":"The easiest way to find a specific contact is to use the Quick search box that appears in the navigation menu at the top left of the screen. You may choose to search by one of several criteria. The criteria can be modified by going to Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Search Preferences . On the Search Preferences page, options are available to customize CiviCRM's Quick search to hide contacts' basic fields that are not normally used in a Quick search and to add custom field options. Once you click in the Quick search box, you can start typing immediately to use the default Name/Email search or you can click again to expose several other criteria in a dropdown selection list. Contacts that match the phrase you enter will appear in a dropdown list below the box. For example, if you are searching with Name/Email and you have left automatic wildcard enabled via Search Preferences , entering \"peter\" will find: people who's first or last name is Peter people who have Peter appearing as part of their name, e.g. Mary Peter son people who have Peter as part of their email address, e.g. blue peter @gmail.com organisations with Peter in their name, e.g. Al peter Community Centre. You often don't need to type the full name of the person - just the first few letters. However, if you don't see the contact you are looking for, either refine the search by typing more characters, or hit the Return key to convert your search into an Advanced Search. Quick search displays up to 10 results (by default). You can change the number of results returned from the Search Preferences screen described above by changing the Autocomplete Results setting. CiviCRM also allows for the collection of a nickname when entering new contacts. For example, \"Joe\" can be a nickname for \"Joseph\" and \"IBM\" can be a nickname for \"International Business Machines\". When you first install CiviCRM you will find \"Joseph\" when searching for \"Joe\" and you'll find \"International Business Machines\" when searching for \"IBM\". You can change this behavior from the Search Preferences screen described above by changing the Include Nickname setting to yes . !!! note If you search by phone then you will need to enter the digits of the phone number without any formatting. The phone search is done against a field that consists only of digits with all non-numeric characters stripped out. !!! tip If you want to search by first and last name, use the format \"Lastname, Firstname\", not \"Firstname Lastname\". For example, \"Peterson, Mary\" not \"Mary Peterson\".","title":"Quick search"},{"location":"civicrm/searching/#advanced-search","text":"Advanced search allows you to search across all the information you have about your contacts. For example, you could find \"all contacts in Venezuela\" or \"all advisory group members\". If you specify two or more categories of information, the search displays every contact that matches all the categories. For instance, you can combine the two criteria just mentioned to find \"all advisory group members in Venezuela\". The Advanced search screen is accessible from the navigation menu Search > Advanced Search . On this screen, search criteria are grouped into sections which refer to different types of data that you can search on, such as address data, notes and information from components such as Contributions or Events. Each group of criteria is shown as a blue bar (known as an \"accordion\" because it expands when you click on it). For example, if you want to search for all people in your database from 16 to 18 years old, click on the Demographics accordion. When it opens, you can specify the birth date range you are interested in.","title":"Advanced search"},{"location":"civicrm/searching/#display-settings-for-results","text":"Advanced Search returns your results as Contact records by default.

Make sure that the fields in this Profile are set to \"Expose Publicly and for Listings\" visibility, and are marked as Results Columns. (For more information about creating Profiles, which are described in detail in the Profiles chapter in the Configuration section.) For example you may want to include columns for Gender and Date of Birth, while eliminating Country. Create a profile that includes birth date, gender and address fields.

The Search in Trash allows you to search contacts that have been deleted but not deleted permanently. When a contact is deleted, the contact and all related data are moved to trash. Only users with the relevant permission will be able to search in trash and will be able to restore the contact from trash.","title":"Search settings"},{"location":"civicrm/searching/#the-date-range-filter","text":"Most component searches include a date range filter.

For more information see the Groups and tags section in the Organising your data chapter. For example you may want to use a relative date range search to find: Contacts who have contributed in the last 7 days (Relative date range - \"From 1 Week ago\") This (financial) year's registered Event Participants (Relative date range - \"This Year\") Contacts who are a certain age Relative dates filters based on the time interval \"week\" assume that Sunday is the first day of the week.

In CiviCRM, the wildcard is represented by the % symbol (you may be familiar with other symbols such as * from other applications). It is most easily understood through examples. Suppose that somebody asked you to find a contact with a first name similar to \"Michael\", but possible something different such as \"Michelle\" or \"Micha\u0142\". If you search for \"Mich%\" you will find all these variations, including a contact who is supposed to be named \"Michael\" but whose name was misspelled as \"Micheal\". Wildcards can be used before, after, or even within words. For example, searching on 'Mich%el' will exclude \"Micha\u0142\" and \"Micheal\" but still find \"Michelle\" and \"Michael\". However, using % by itself can produce unexpected results for data where the value in the database is 'empty' (as opposed to NULL. Using a single % will return results for empty values. To avoid these results, eg if you are searching \"any record which has any data in this field\" using %_%. This will return results only where there is at least a single character, and will ignore all empty (as well as NULL) results.","title":"The wildcard (%)"},{"location":"civicrm/searching/#case-sensitivity","text":"Note that when you search for character strings, the search is not case-sensitive. For example, if you search for 'brooklyn', the search will return strings with capitalised letters if the string exists, e.g. 'Brooklyn' or 'BROOKLYN'. Entering \"mi%el\" in lowercase will also find contacts with an upper case 'M' in their name.","title":"Case sensitivity"},{"location":"civicrm/searching/#default-number-of-rows-to-be-returned","text":"In CiviCRM Advanced Searches and in CiviCRM reports the number of rows displayed on the screen has by default been 50 previously.

They are useful for keeping track of groups of contacts meeting certain criteria, for example 'all members based in Europe'. Creating a smart group is easy: you search based on your desired criteria and then choose 'Create smart group'. Once the smart group is created, each time you ask to see the contacts in a group, CiviCRM will carry out a search and show you contacts that meet the criteria you specified. Smart groups are a really powerful and useful part of CiviCRM. They come in handy in many different situations. Spend some time making sure you understand smart groups and how you might be able to use them. When might I use a smart group? Smart groups come in handy in many different situations. Here are a couple of examples. Smart groups and profiles: a membership directory A smart group could be used in conjunction with a profile to display a directory of members on your website. To do this, you would create a smart group that includes members of your organization and create a profile that includes the fields that you would want to display in your directory. You would then configure the profile to only show contacts that were in that smart group. When a contact becomes a member - for example, when they fill in your membership form and pay online - they will automatically be added to the smart group and therefore be published in your members directory. Smart groups as mailing lists: an events newsletter Lets assume that anyone who has registered for or attended an event will want to receive our events newsletter. We can create a smart group with that includes all people who have registered or attended an event, and specify that this smart group is a mailing list. It will then be available for use in CiviMail and we can use it to send the events newsletter. As people register to attend an event - or are marked as having attended an event - they will be added automatically to the smart group and hence subscribed to the newsletter. Smart groups respect people's subscription preferences. If people unsubscribe from the newsletter, they will be removed from the smart group. Creating smart groups Smart groups can be created from the search results generated by many of CiviCRM's search forms. Lets say we wanted to create a smart group of all donors who have not yet been sent a thank-you letter to help us manage our work-flow for thanking donors. As we send letters, the donors receiving them will automatically leave the smart group, allowing us to have an always accurate list of people to send letters to. We can use the advanced search to create this smart group (you could try this on the demo site - http://demo.civicrm.org if you don't have contributions in your CiviCRM installation). Go to Search > Find Contacts > Advanced Search . Scroll down to the Contributions section. Check Thank-you date not set ? and choose Donation from the financial type drop-down menu. Click Search at the bottom of the page. Select all records From the Actions drop-down menu select Group - create smart group . Give the smart group a name and description and optionally designate it as a mailing list and give if a parent group. Click Save Smart Group . You can also create a smart group from SearchKit. From any search that returns contacts, just click +Add on the left hand side and then select Smart Group . Your smart group will now appear in all the usual places where you see groups. Try editing a contact in the smart group so that they no longer match the criteria. You'll see that they are removed from the smart group. If the contact is not removed immediately, it may be that you have smart group caching turned on (see Smart group caching below). Changing criteria for smart groups You may want to refine the criteria that your smart group uses to select contacts. For example, you may want to edit a smart group consisting of all current members to include new members as well. You can do this from the Manage groups screen. Click Manage Groups . To edit the search criteria of a particular smart group, click Settings next to that group. On the group settings screen, click Edit Smart Group Criteria at bottom left. This will bring up the a screen similar to the one that you originally used to create the smart group with the search results displayed. Clicking on the bar at the top of the screen will bring up the criteria that you used to define the smart group. You can then update the criteria and once you're happy with the results, select all records and choose Update Smart Group from the Actions list. Your smart group is now based on the new criteria. Adding and removing smart group members manually By default, smart group membership is determined by the criteria outlined in the smart group settings. However, you can override the criteria by manually adding or removing contacts from the group. You can manually add contacts to a smart group using the same workflows you would use to add contacts to a standard group. If you navigate to the Groups tab on an individual's contact record, you won't have the option to Remove via a button the same way you would for a standard group. However, you can manually remove someone from a smart group by going to Contacts > Manage Groups . Select Contacts on the right-hand column of the chosen group to view all of the contacts currently within the group. Find and check the box next to the contact you want to remove. Use the Actions dropdown and select Group - remove contacts . Confirm the removal and the group record will now show up under Past Groups for that contact. CiviCRM will override the smart group criteria based on manual adds or removals, even if there is a change in a contact's eligibility for inclusion based on that criteria. Once a contact has been removed from a smart group, there will be an option to Delete their smart group record under the Groups tab on their contact record. If you Delete the record, they will again be subject to smart group inclusion based on the set criteria. Smart group caching For performance reasons, smart groups are often cached, i.e. the contacts that meet the smart group criteria are saved in memory for a certain amount of time. This speed things up because CiviCRM doesn't need to run the search each time you want to use the smart group. If your query is simple and involves a small number of contacts, the speed up may not be significant. If it is complex and involves a lot of contacts, it may be very significant and even necessary. The down side of caching is that you need to wait up to 5 minutes for the query to be updated. Depending on how you use smart groups this may not be an issue. The default expiry time for a smart group in newer versions of CiviCRM is 5 minutes. You can adjust the smart group query cache 'timeout', i.e. the amount of time the cache is considered a valid reflection of the smart group in Administer > Customize Data and Screens > Search Preferences . When a group is accessed CiviCRM will check to see if the currently cached group is older than is allowed by the timeout. In the event that the timeout has passed CiviCRM will rebuild the group and reset the timeout to now + cache timeout setting . Setting the timeout to 0 turns off the cache altogether.","title":"Smart groups"},{"location":"civicrm/smart-groups/#smart-groups","text":"Smart groups are 'saved searches'.
